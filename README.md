# VRMobility - A VR Rehabilitation Game for Stroke Survivors

A VR-based rehabilitation exergame designed to assist stroke survivors in regaining arm mobility through engaging and interactive exercises.

## Overview

Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability, with many survivors facing motor impairments that make daily tasks challenging. Traditional rehabilitation methods often suffer from low patient engagement due to their repetitive nature.

VRMobility leverages Virtual Reality (VR) and gamification to make rehabilitation exercises more immersive, enjoyable, and effective.

## Objectives

- Improve rehabilitation engagement through interactive VR exercises
- Enhance motor function by incorporating therapeutic movements
- Provide motivation using gamification techniques
- Create an accessible and adaptable tool for different recovery stages

## Gameplay & Features

### Level 1: Meadow
- **Task:** Collect and place stars in a basket
- **Targeted Movement:** Arm raising, gripping exercises
- **Benefit:** Encourages gross motor function recovery
